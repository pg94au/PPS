The PPS printing system was originally developed for the Linux operating system 
as a replacement for the BSD lpr printing system.  The goals in creating this
system were ease of management and use, as well as built-in page accounting
facilities.  It was created for use in the Faculty of Education at Brock
University, where it is being used as a means by which laser printing
services are provided to students and staff in a public computer lab.<BR>
