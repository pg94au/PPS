The queue display/update form allows you to set the various attributes for
each queue in the system, including the method of charging and the amount to

In addition to device management, users of the printing system are also
managed through a similar interface.  Users can be added, or viewed, allowing
them to be modified.<BR>

Each user in the system has essential information, such as a usercode, balance
and accounting status, as well as information useful for administrative
purposes, such as a full name, student id and other notes.<BR>
