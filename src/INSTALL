PPS Printing System

Copyright (c) 1997-1999 Paul Grebenc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PPS printing system is a print spooling system whose main advantage
at this point is its page accounting ability.  While many features may still
be desirable, this system, combined with Samba, provides an excellent means
of providing a page accounting system for Windows 95 clients in a network.
It was developed to be used in the Faculty of Education at Brock University,
St. Catharines, Canada, where it has been in use since the summer of 1998.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS:

In order to install and run this system, you must already have Mini SQL
installed and running on your server.  A copy of Mini SQL, and instructions
regarding its installation, can be found at http://www.hughes.com.au.
Additionally, an HTTP server must be running, locally at least, on the server
on which the PPS system is installed, in order to provide for the
administration utilities.  The free Apache HTTP server can be found at
http://www.apache.org.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE IMPATIENT:
------------------------------

Type:

configure
make
make install
make database
make installman

Set up your web server so that you can access the web_bin directory installed
under the PPS root directory with cgi-bin capability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PATIENT:
----------------------------


CONFIGURATION:

In order to build a Makefile and config.h for your system, execute the
following command:

./configure

You may optionally specify a --prefix=<path> option to configure, if you wish
to install this system in some root directory other than /usr/local/pps.

After the configure script has successfully completed, you SHOULD THEN EXAMINE
THE Makefile TO MAKE ANY CHANGES WHICH MIGHT BE NECESSARY.  These options are
described in the Makefile.

Optionally, values affecting limits imposed on the system which can be
configured are in the file pps.h.  You may change the following options:

- The MAX_QUEUES and MAX_PRINTERS_PER_QUEUE values should be set appropriately
  based on the requirements for the site at which the system is installed.
  Setting these values higher than necessary does no harm, other than using a
  small amount of memory.

- The QUEUE_LENGTH value should be set to the maximum number of jobs that can
  be stored in each queue at one time.  This number could be kept small or
  large, depending on whether one wants the possibility of a huge backlog of
  jobs in a queue should someone turn a printer off, or should it run out of
  paper, etc.


COMPILING:

Simply type "make" to build the executables.


INSTALLING:

As root, type:

make install		(install executables in the system)
make database		(create the PPS database in mSQL)
make installman		(install man pages in the system)

Next, configure your HTTP server.  For the Apache HTTP server, do either of
the following:

1. Configure the server to enable the FollowSymLinks in the root (htdocs)
   directory.  Set the symbolic link from htdocs/pps to the web_bin directory
   of the PPS installation.  (ie. htdocs/pps -> /usr/local/pps/web_bin)

2. a) Add an entry for the web_bin directory to access.conf, such as the
      following (this example includes password protection; you will have to
      create your own .htpasswd file if you require authorization):

	<Directory /usr/local/pps/web_bin>
	AllowOverride None
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

	AuthUserFile /usr/local/pps/web_bin/.htpasswd
	AuthGroupFile /dev/null
	AuthName Printing_Administration
	AuthType Basic

	<Limit GET>
	require valid-user
	order deny,allow
	deny from all
	allow from .our-domain.net
	</Limit>

	</Directory>

   b) Create an alias for the PPS administration utilities in the srm.conf
      file:

	Alias /pps  /usr/local/pps/web_bin

   c) Uncomment, or create, the following line in httpd.conf:

	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

3. Configure a link to web_user as above, but without password protection.


RUNNING / CONFIGURING / ADMINISTERING:

Execute the ppd daemon as root.  Usually, you will want to have the daemon
start up each time the system is brought up, and so you should put in your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local file, or equivalent.  (Start it as a background process)

Use any system on your network with an HTTP client (web browser) to access the
administration interface.  Simply view http://site.your-domain.net/pps, if
you have configured your http daemon as described above.  Add, remove and
configure users, queues and printers through this interface.  Note, the
daemon need not be restarted after changes are made through this interface.
